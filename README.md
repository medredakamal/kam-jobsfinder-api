# JobsFinder API - Built-in JavaScript

I have created this app using only JavaScript , where there is a json file filled in with jobs data , and you search inside this data for jobs
Instead of "jobs.json" file , you can use an API , and do some changes on "script.js" if needed

Hope that make sense to learn JavaScript more, or to use this on one of your projects
